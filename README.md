# HindiNext
HindiNext is an NLP project that develops a "Next word prediction" model for Hindi language. We try out different deep neural networks trained on large hindi text corpus to predict the next word in a sentence. This can help users to type more efficiently, and it can also improve language fluency and help users to create natural and expressive written content in Hindi.
